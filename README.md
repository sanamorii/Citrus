# Citrus  

A ~~2.5D~~ 2D game engine developed using C, SDL2, &amp; OpenGL.  
No special features (that I can think of) - just a personal project made for fun and to further my knowledge.

Currently the targeted platform for Citrus is mingw32 & Windows systems - in the future I will be implementing compatibility for both Windows and Linux once I become more better at C.
- Note: I might migrate Citrus to C++ sometime in the future.

## Building
Build Platform is for Windows using mingw32 (for now):
```cmd
git clone 'https://github.com/sanamorii/citrus.git'  
cd citrus
mingw32-make
```
Builds will be in `./bin/debug/` by default - compile output can be specified in `Makefile`.
